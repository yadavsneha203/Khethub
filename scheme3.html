        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><h3>SCHEME</h3><br>The Government of India has introduced an old age pension scheme for all land
            holding Small and Marginal Farmers (SMFs) in the country, namely, the “Pradhan
            Mantri Kisan Maan-Dhan Yojana (PM-KMY)”, as a voluntary and contributory
            pension scheme for the entry age group of 18 to 40 years. The Scheme is effective from
            the 9th August, 2019.<br><h3>Objective and Benefits</h3>There have been a series of interventions for income and price support by the
            Government for farmers. However, there is a felt need to create a social security net for
            the farmers as old age may result in loss of livelihood for many of them. Farming
            requires hard work in fields which becomes difficult at an advanced age. The problem is
            compounded in respect of small and marginal farmers as they have minimal or no savings
            to provide for old age. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan-Dhan Yojana (PM-KMY) provides
            for an assured monthly pension of Rs. 3000/- to all land holding Small and Marginal
            Farmers (SMFs), whether male or female, on their attaining the age of 60 years. Farmers
            falling within the purview of the exclusion criteria (as defined in Para 5 of these
            guidelines) are, however, not eligible for the benefit. The key features and other
            consequential benefits accruing to the subscribers of the Scheme are detailed further in
            these guidelines.
