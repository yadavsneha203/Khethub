        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This scheme aims to relieve farmers from their loan burdens under certain conditions.
            <h3>What are Farm Loan Waivers?</h3>
            About: Farm loan waivers are financial relief measures implemented by governments, where certain agricultural loans are forgiven, relieving farmers from the burden of repayment to reduce the distress among farmers.
            These waivers are often announced during election campaigns as promises to garner support from the farming community.
            Farm loan waivers involve the government absorbing the outstanding debt of farmers by providing a budgetary allocation to banks and financial institutions.
            Farmers face numerous challenges, including disputed land holdings, depleted groundwater reserves, poor soil quality, rising input costs, and low crop productivity.
            Due to a lack of assured remuneration for their produce, farmers often borrow funds from banks or private lenders at high-interest rates.
            Loan waivers provide temporary relief to indebted farmers, but they are not a long-term solution to agrarian distress.
            Implementation of Waivers:
            In times of crop failure or natural calamities, governments may waive penal interest, reschedule loans, or completely waive off outstanding loans.
            The government's budget absorbs the financial liability, not the banks.
            The waivers can be selective, based on factors like loan type (short-term, medium-term, long-term), categories of farmers, or loan sources.
            <h3>How Do Farm Loan Waivers Affect Farmers and Governments?</h3>
            <h4>Effects on Farmers:</h4>
            Waivers provide short-term relief to farmers struggling with debt, especially in the wake of poor harvests due to natural calamities.
            Critics argue that waivers can lead to a culture of non-repayment, expecting future waivers, which can undermine the credit discipline among the farming community.
            Post-waiver periods often see a tightening of credit as banks become wary of lending, potentially affecting the farmersâ€™ ability to invest in the next crop cycle.
            A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) found that the 2008 scheme benefitted several ineligible farmers while leaving out many deserving small and marginal farmers.
            Implementation Challenges: A recent SBI study in 2022 revealed that only half of the beneficiaries of the nine farm loan waivers announced by State governments since 2014 have actually received write-offs.
            Maharashtra had a relatively high implementation rate. In contrast, Telangana had the poorest implementation.
            <h4>Effects on Governments:</h4>
            <h5>Negative Impacts:</h5>
            The most immediate impact is the strain on government finances. Waiving loans means forgoing a significant amount of revenue that could be used for other social programs or infrastructure development.
            According to a NABARD report, the 1990 ARDR scheme cost the Central government Rs 7825 crores. States were forced to take additional loans from the RBI to cover their share of the loan waivers.
            Large-scale loan waivers can increase government borrowing, leading to higher interest rates and inflation, undermining economic stability.
            Additionally, waivers often fail to tackle core agricultural issues like low crop prices and inadequate infrastructure, offering only short-term relief.
            <h5>Positive Impacts:</h5>
            Farm loan waivers can redirect funds from debt repayment to other areas. This allows farmers to reinvest in agriculture by purchasing better inputs to increase productivity, and diversify into other agricultural activities like poultry, dairy, or horticulture to generate additional income.
            Governments that implement loan waivers can gain political capital among the large farming population. A NABARD study from 1987 to 2020 found that out of 21 State governments that announced waivers before State polls, only four lost.
